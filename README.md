With the rapid growth of online streaming platforms, personalized movie recommendations have
become essential for enhancing user experience. A robust recommendation system should
accurately predict user preferences based on multiple factors such as movie ratings, genre, cast,
director, user demographics, and historical viewing patterns.
Key Objectives:
1. Identifying Influential Factors:
o Analyze the impact of movie ratings, genre popularity, cast, director influence, and
audience demographics on recommendations.
o Examine whether external factors like trending topics, awards, and critic reviews
influence movie suggestions.
2. Effectiveness of the Recommendation System:
o Evaluate how well the system aligns with user preferences and satisfaction.
o Assess whether collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models
perform best for this dataset.
